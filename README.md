# IMU Data Importer for Maya

This small MEL script allows CSV files generated by Inertial Measurement Units (IMU's) to be translated into Maya animations. Maya objects can be automatically keyframed in batches and adjusted by specifying CSV files containing Euler angles.

### Project Installation

1. Move the three scripts, "CSVImport.mel", "CSVImportUI.mel", and "CSVImportFunctionMatrix.mel", into the scripts directory of your Maya project
2. Open the Maya script editor
3. Drag the filed named "CSVImport.mel" into the code area "MEL" tab
4. Save the script to the Maya shelf by clicking the "Save Script to Shelf" button at the top of the script editor

### Usage
1. Place the CSV file in the "data" folder of the project, which should contain the Euler rotations in three consecutive columns
2. Open the tool in the shelf
3. Specify the CSV filename, the 1-based starting column of the rotations in the CSV file, rotation offsets, and the Maya object name. CSV FPS specifies the sampling rate of the CSV file. The tool will interpolate the samples so that the animation plays in real time in Maya.
